# Recipe for Vada pav
- Make Potato Stuffing
  1. Boil 2 large potatoes that weigh about 350 grams. Peel and then mash them with a fork in a bowl. You can boil or steam the potatoes in a pan, Instant pot or pressure cooker. Remember to drain the water very well from the boiled potatoes before you mash them. Also crush 6 to 7 small/medium-sized garlic cloves and 1 to 2 green chilies in a mortar pestle.
  2. Heat 2 to 3 teaspoons of oil in a small pan. Add ½ a teaspoon of mustard seeds and crackle them. Then add 7 to 8 curry leaves and a pinch of asafoetida (hing). Stir and sauté for about 5 seconds.
  3.  Add the crushed garlic cloves and green chilies mixture to the pan. Add ⅛ teaspoon of turmeric powder (about 2 to 3 pinches).
  4. Stir for some seconds or until the raw aroma of garlic goes away.
  5. Pour this tempering mixture together with the oil to the mashed potatoes.
  6. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of chopped coriander leaves and salt as required.
  7. Mix everything well. Then make small to medium balls from the mashed potato mixture. Flatten these balls a bit. Cover and keep aside.
- Make cover of Batata vada
  1. In another bowl, make a smooth batter from 1 to 1.25 cups besan (gram flour), ⅛ teaspoon turmeric powder (about 2 to 3 pinches), a pinch of asafoetida (hing), a pinch of baking soda (optional), salt and ½ cup water or as needed. The batter should have a medium-thick flowing consistency. It should not be too thick or thin. If the batter becomes thin, add 1 or 2 tablespoons of gram flour. If the batter becomes thick, then add 1 or 2 tablespoons of water.
  2. Dip the slightly flattened potato balls in the batter and coat it evenly with the batter.
- Frying Batata Vada
  1. Before you dip the batata vada in the batter, heat oil in a pan or wok (kadai). When the oil becomes hot then dip the batata vada in the batter to coat as shown in the above steps. Carefully and gently drop these batter coated potato balls in medium hot oil.
  2. Depending on the size of the kadai or pan, you can add more or less of the vada while frying. But don’t overcrowd the pan
  3. When one side firms up, becomes slightly crisp and golden then only turn over gently with a slotted spoon. Fry the second side. This way deep fry them till golden, turning a couple of times as needed.
  4. Drain them on kitchen paper towels. Make all batata vada this way and set aside.
